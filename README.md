Recipe Suggestion Bot:
A simple AI-powered chatbot that suggests recipes based on user-inputted ingredients, cooking preferences, and time constraints. Built using Python and LLM integration, this interactive tool takes in key cooking inputs—like ingredients, dietary choice (veg/non-veg), preferred cuisine, and available cooking time—and generates an easy-to-follow recipe.
Accepts ingredients from the user via a text input.
Allows selection of food type (Vegetarian/Non-Vegetarian).
Includes cooking time and cuisine filters.

Generates a complete recipe including:
* Dish name
* List of ingredients
* Step-by-step instructions
Uses LLM (like OpenAI or similar) for dynamic recipe generation.
Lightweight, user-friendly interface using Jupyter widgets or web-based form
